I just migrated the site to Hugo!

Right now I am using the Sam theme ([Github](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam)), created by Victoria Drake ([Website](https://victoria.dev)).

In the future, I plan to create my own theme for this website and public release too. I still have to figure out much of how templating works in Hugo, so as a first, I'll try to set up a projects page similar to the one I had on the old site with cards.
